# rib

A minimalist EPUB reader. Name is short for '**r**ead **i**n **b**rowser'. Currently in development. Expect library format to be unstable during development; accordingly, if you care about preserving your library for long-term use, exercise caution when updating.

Tested on Windows; currently untested on Linux and Mac, but theoretically should support them as well.

## Usage

```
rib book.epub
```

View help menu for advanced functionality:

# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Fail faster when encountering an error in the course of opening an EPUB.
- Rename CLI `stylesheets` option to `stylesheet`. (Although it can be passed multiple times in a program-invocation, each time it's passed only covers one sheet, so this name seems less confusing.)
- Clarify help-text on assorted CLI options.

## 0.1.1

- Pass fragment identifiers from navigation wrapper to book section
